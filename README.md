Hospital Data Management Project
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how healthcare data can be transformed into actionable insights using SQL, Python, and Power BI. The goal is to analyze hospital operations, patient demographics, billing, and disease trends to support better decision‑making in healthcare management.

🎯 Objectives
Build a relational database in SQL Server to store hospital data (patients, doctors, treatments, billing).

Use Python for data cleaning, preprocessing, and exporting results into SQL Server.

Design Power BI dashboards to visualize KPIs and trends for hospital administrators.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
SQL Server (SSMS) → Database design, queries, and data storage.

Power BI → Interactive dashboards and visualizations.

📊 Key Insights from Dashboard
Patient Demographics: Total patients, average age distribution.

Doctor Specialization: Breakdown across General Medicine, Neurology, Pediatrics, Surgery, etc.

Billing Analysis: Payment mode distribution (UPI, Cash, Card, Insurance).

Disease Trends: Patient counts across major diseases (Diabetes, Cancer, Asthma, COVID‑19, etc.).

Financial KPIs: Total revenue, paid vs pending amounts, state‑wise billing.

🚀 Workflow
Data Collection → Hospital records simulated in CSV/Excel.

Database Integration (SQL) → Import cleaned data into SQL Server tables.

Visualization (Power BI) → Connect to SQL Server, design dashboards with filters and KPIs.

📈 Business Value
Helps hospital administrators track financial health and pending payments.

Provides insights into doctor workload and specialization distribution.

Supports resource allocation by analyzing disease trends and patient inflow.

Enhances decision‑making with real‑time dashboards.
